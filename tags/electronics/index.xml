      <description>&lt;p&gt;Implemented a system which can detect notes, basic chords, and complex chords with 100% accuracy in real-time if they are played one at a time. However, if a song is played continuously in real-time, the accuracy is 91% for any music which has a tempo of 2 seconds. Slower tempo equates to higher accuracy and vice-versa. This is due to the temporal resolution of the system. The scope of this research is that it is specific to a guitar, though it can be extended to all stringed instruments.&lt;/p&gt;
