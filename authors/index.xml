      <description>&lt;!-- Nelson Bighetti is a professor of artificial intelligence at the Stanford AI Lab. His research interests include distributed robotics, mobile computing and programmable matter. He leads the Robotic Neurobiology group, which develops self-reconfiguring robots, systems of self-organizing robots, and mobile sensor networks.

&lt;!-- I am a data scientist at the Asian Institute of Management (AIM) and am a part of the cohort of the first data science master&#39;s in the Philippines. Prior to this, I was a software engineer creating mobile applications such as Cebu Pacific and GoAir. In addition, I also do data science and software development consultancy work.  --&gt;

&lt;!-- My interests include artificial intelligence, application development, data engineering and electronics.  --&gt;

&lt;!-- I am a data scientist at Vivant Corporation. I got my training from the first data science master&#39;s in the Philippines. Prior to this, I was a software engineer creating mobile applications such as Cebu Pacific and GoAir. In addition, I also do data science and software development consultancy work.  --&gt;

&lt;!-- Hi, everyone! I am Jude. I am a data scientist, computer scientist, and software engineer. My work includes creating portfolio model for electricity market, forecasting various types of data, and development of web applications. In addition, I also do consultancy and teaching work. 

Since my first year in college, I loved the things that we did in Computer Science such as programming and formulating algorithms. Presently, I still feel the same, which is why I wish to further my understanding in this field though with more inclination towards artificial intelligence. This lead me to take a Master&#39;s in Data Science. Some of my other interests are signal processing and electronics. I had lots of fun doing these kinds of things, and I feel that it&#39;s my responsibility to share what I know to others, leading me to become a tutor. Because of that, teaching became one of the things I am passionate about. When I do it, I get the feeling that I have contributed something big to the world. During my undergraduate years, I was part of an organization under a department in my college wherein I tutor fellow students for free. I usually teach math, programming, and a bit of electronics. Up until now, I still teach but focusing more on data science topics.

I also regularly join competitions and hackathons. I have been to many national and international competitions which aim to solve relevant issues in the society through the use of data science and software engineering. I believe that by doing this, I can turn what I have learned into something of use to our community.

In addition, I am also fond of doing sports, watching animes, and playing video games. --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hi, everyone! I am Jude, a data scientist, computer scientist, and software engineer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;How my Data Science journey began..&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even way back during my first year as a Computer Science undergraduate student, I had already developed a deep love for programming and formulating algorithms. To this day, I feel the same way. To further my understanding with more inclination towards artificial intelligence, I took up a Master&amp;rsquo;s in Data Science at the Asian Institute of Management, where I graduated with high distinction and salutatorian of our batch in June 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;How the journey&amp;rsquo;s been like so far..&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My work includes creating portfolio models for the electricity market, forecasting, analyzing structured and unstructured data, and developing web applications. I also do consultancy and teaching work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, I regularly join competitions and hackathons. I have been to many national and international competitions which aim to solve relevant issues in the society through the use of data science and software engineering. I believe that by doing this, I can turn what I have learned into something of use to our community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;What other things keep my soul on fire?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the industry being relatively new, I feel that it&amp;rsquo;s my responsibility to share what I know with others. Because of this, I have developed a passion for teaching. During my undergraduate years, I tutor fellow students for free. I usually teach math, programming, and a bit of electronics under an organization I was a part of. Up until now, I still teach but with more focus on data science topics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My interests also include signal processing and electronics. I am also fond of doing sports, watching animes, and playing video games.&lt;/p&gt;
